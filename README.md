# ASSIGNMENT-08
# PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION USING SVM

Methodology:

1. Choose a Dataset: Select a multi-class dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Make sure it fits your criteria of having between 5k and 30k rows.
2. Load and Preprocess the Data: Use pandas to load the dataset and preprocess it as necessary. This may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into features and labels.
3. Split the Dataset: Split the dataset into training and testing sets with a 70-30 ratio. Do this for 10 different samples to ensure robustness of your results.
4. Optimize SVM: Use scikit-learn to create an SVM model and optimize it for each sample. Perform 100 iterations for each optimization.
5. Report Best Parameters: Record the best parameters for each sample.
6. Plot Convergence Graph/ Linear curve: For the sample with the highest accuracy, plot the convergence graph to visualize the optimization process.
7. Perform Data Analytics: Conduct basic data analytics on the selected dataset. This could include summary statistics, data visualization, and any other relevant analysis.

Steps to be followed:

Step 1: Choose a multi-class dataset from the UCI library with the specified criteria.
Step 2: Load the dataset and perform basic data analytics.
Step 3: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets with a 70-30 split for 10 different samples.
Step 4: Optimize the SVM for each sample with 100 iterations and record the best parameters.
Step 5: Plot the convergence graph for the sample with the maximum accuracy.
Step 6: Showcase the complete results, including the comparative performance table and convergence graph, on GitHub.
